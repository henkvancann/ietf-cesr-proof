Abstract

   CESR Proof Signatures are an extension to the Composable Event
   Streaming Representation (CESR) that provide transposable
   cryptographic signature attachments on self-addressing data (SAD).  A
   SAD (such as an Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) Verifiable
   Credential) may be signed with a CESR Proof Signature and streamed
   alongside any other CESR content.  In addition, a signed SAD can be
   embedded inside another SAD and the CESR proof signature attachment
   can be transposed to the outer SAD and streamed without losing any
   cryptographic integrity.

1.  Introduction

   Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is a dual text-
   binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary
   concatenation composability.  The CESR specification not only
   provides the definition of the streaming format but also the codes
   needed for creating and sharing all event types and signatures on all
   event types for the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI).  While
   all KERI event messages are self-addressing data (SAD), there is a
   broad class of SADs that are not KERI events but that require
   signature attachments.  ACDC Verifiable credentials fit into this
   class of SADs.  With more complex data structures represented as
   SADs, such as verifiable credentials, there is a need to provide
   signature attachments on nested subsets of SADs.  Similar to indices
   in indexed controller signatures in KERI that specify the location of
   the public key they represent, nested SAD signatures need a path
   mechanism to specify the exact location of the nested content that
   they are signing.  CESR Proof Signatures provide this mechanism with
   the CESR SAD Path Language and a new attachment code, detailed below.

1.1.  Transposable Signature Attachments

   There are several events in KERI that can contain context specific
   embedded self-addressing data (SADs).  Exchange events (exn) for
   peer-to-peer communication and Replay events (rpy) for responding to
   data requests as well as Expose events (exp) for providing anchored
   data are all examples of KERI events that contain embedded SADs as
   part of their payload.  If the SAD payload for one of these event
   types is signed with a CESR attachment, the resulting structure is
   not embeddable in one of the mapping serializations (JSON, CBOR,
   MessagePack) supported by CESR.  To solve this problem, CESR Proof
   Signatures are transposable in that an entire signature group on any
   given SAD can be transposed to attach to the end of an outer SAD
   without losing its meaning.  This unique feature is provided by a
   root path designation in the outermost attachment code of any SAD
   signature group that can be updated to point to the embedding
   location of the outer SAD.  Protocols for verifiable credential
   issuance and proof presentation can be defined using this capability
   to embed the same verifiable credential SAD at and location in an
   outer exn message as appropriate for the protocol without having to
   define a unique signature scheme for each protocol.

2.  CESR SAD Path Language

   CESR Proof Signatures defines a SAD Path Language to be used in
   signature attachments for specifying the location of the SAD content
   within the signed SAD that a signature attachment is verifying.  This
   path language has a more limited scope than alternatives like
   JSONPath and is therefore simpler and easier to encode in CESR
   signature attachments.  SADs in CESR and therefore CESR Proof
   Signatures require static field ordering of all maps.  The SAD path
   language takes advantage of this feature to allow for a base64
   compatible syntax into SADs even when a SAD uses non-base64
   compatible characters for field labels.

2.1.  Description and Usage

   The SAD path language contains a single reserved character, the -
   (dash) character.  Similar to the / (forward slack) character in
   URLs, the - in the SAD Path Language is the path separator between
   components of the path.  The - was selected because it is a one of
   the valid base64 characters.

   The simplest path in the SAD Path Language is a single - character
   representing the root path which specifies the top level of the SAD
   content.

   Root Path -

   After the root path, path components follow, delimited by the -
   character.  Path components may be integer indices into field labels
   or arrays or may be full field labels.  No wildcards are supported by
   the SAD Path Language

   An example SAD Path using only labels that resolve to map contexts
   follows:

   -a-personal

   In addition, integers can be specified and their meaning is dependent
   on the context of the SAD.

   -1-12-personal-0

   The rules for a SAD Path Language processor are simple.  If a path
   consists of only a single -, it represents the root of the SAD and
   therefore the entire SAD content.  Following any - character is a
   path component that points to a field if the current context is a map
   in the SAD or is an index of an element if the current context is an
   array.  It is an error for any sub-path to resolve to a value this is
   not a map or an array.

   The root context (after the initial -) is always a map.  Therefore,
   the first path component represents a field of that map.  The SAD is
   traversed following the path components as field labels or indexes in
   arrays until the end of the path is reached.  The value at the end of
   the path is then returned as the resolution of the SAD Path.  If the
   current context is a map and the path component is an integer, the
   path component represents an index into fields of the map.  This
   feature takes advantage of the static field ordering of SADs and is
   used against any SAD that contains field labels that use non-base64
   compatible characters or the - character.  Any combination of integer
   and field label path components can be used when the current context
   is a map.  All path components MUST be an integer when the current
   context is an array.

2.2.  SAD Path Examples

   This section provides some more examples for SAD Path expressions.
   The examples are based on Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs)
   representing verifiable credentials.

   It is required to embed this credential in any other KERI message
   (eg. rpy, exp, exn) along with the CESR Proof.  Since the proof is a
   CESR attachment, this message cannot simply be embedded in another
   JSON document.  Therefore, a method is needed to apply the attachment
   to the outermost message while maintaining its location pointers and
   meaning for the nested SAD that it represents.

   Given the following signed SAD:
